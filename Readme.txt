Introduction:

This package provides a Matlab implementation of Mixtures of Conditional Tree-structured Bayesian Networks (MC) [Hong, Batal, Hauskrecht 2014] that builds mixtures of structured prediction models for multi-label classification.

To train a model, use CTBN/MC/train_MC.m. To use a trained model for prediction, use CTBN/MC/predict_MC.m.

demo.m contains a demonstration script that learns and uses the CTBN models on the emotions dataset [Trohidis et al. 2008].
